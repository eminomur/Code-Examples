# switch-case-implementation-with-object-support
Basic switch-case implementation in C++.

Code does not work precisely as original switch-case, yet
Missing parts:
    1) Default in switch-case is not implemented
    2) Absence of break reserved word in a true case does not work as original switch-case (it should not check for every case if at least one case is proved to be true but it does)
